    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        We wanted to make Treble because we love music!
    </h3><br/>
    <h4>
        However, often we get narrowed down into the songs we already know we like, and struggle to broaden our
        horizons. <br/>
        So we came up with the idea of an app that can suggest new music to us, based on what we already like! <br/>
        <br/>
        We made Treble for our second year Web Application Development course at the University of Glasgow.
